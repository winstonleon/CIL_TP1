Expert guide for interpreting and fixing n8n validation errors.

## Validation Philosophy

**Validate early, validate often**

Validation is typically iterative:
- Expect validation feedback loops
- Usually 2-3 validate → fix cycles
- Average: 23s thinking about errors, 58s fixing them

**Key insight**: Validation is an iterative process, not one-shot!

---

## Error Severity Levels

### 1. Errors (Must Fix)
**Blocks workflow execution** - Must be resolved before activation

**Types**:
- `missing_required` - Required field not provided
- `invalid_value` - Value doesn't match allowed options
- `type_mismatch` - Wrong data type (string instead of number)
- `invalid_reference` - Referenced node doesn't exist
- `invalid_expression` - Expression syntax error

**Example**:
```json
{
  "type": "missing_required",
  "property": "channel",
  "message": "Channel name is required",
  "fix": "Provide a channel name (lowercase, no spaces, 1-80 characters)"
}
```

### 2. Warnings (Should Fix)
**Doesn't block execution** - Workflow can be activated but may have issues

**Types**:
- `best_practice` - Recommended but not required — surfaces under `ai-friendly` / `strict` only
- `deprecated` - Using old API/feature — surfaces under every profile
- `security` - Hardcoded secrets, unauthenticated webhooks — surfaces under every profile
- `performance` - Potential performance issue — advisory, `ai-friendly` / `strict`

**Example** (best-practice — appears under `ai-friendly` / `strict`):
```json
{
  "type": "warning",
  "nodeName": "Slack",
  "message": "Slack API can have rate limits and transient failures"
}
```

### 3. Suggestions (Optional)
**Nice to have** - Improvements that could enhance workflow

**Types**:
- `optimization` - Could be more efficient
- `alternative` - Better way to achieve same result

---

## The Validation Loop

### Pattern from Telemetry
**7,841 occurrences** of this pattern:

```
1. Configure node
   ↓
2. validate_node (23 seconds thinking about errors)
   ↓
3. Read error messages carefully
   ↓
4. Fix errors
   ↓
5. validate_node again (58 seconds fixing)
   ↓
6. Repeat until valid (usually 2-3 iterations)
```

### Example
```javascript
// Iteration 1
let config = {
  resource: "channel",
  operation: "create"
};

const result1 = validate_node({
  nodeType: "nodes-base.slack",
  config,
  profile: "runtime"
});
// → Error: Missing "name"

// ⏱️  23 seconds thinking...

// Iteration 2
config.name = "general";

const result2 = validate_node({
  nodeType: "nodes-base.slack",
  config,
  profile: "runtime"
});
// → Error: Missing "text"

// ⏱️  58 seconds fixing...

// Iteration 3
config.text = "Hello!";

const result3 = validate_node({
  nodeType: "nodes-base.slack",
  config,
  profile: "runtime"
});
// → Valid! ✅
```

**This is normal!** Don't be discouraged by multiple iterations.

---

## Validation Profiles

The four profiles are **cumulative** (n8n-mcp ≥ 2.63.0): each surfaces everything the lower one does, plus more. The dividing line is best-practice *advisories* — `minimal` and `runtime` withhold them; `ai-friendly` and `strict` add them. Errors are the same across every profile except that `minimal` skips a few config-level checks (e.g. enum validation of an explicit `operation`). Security and deprecation warnings surface under every profile.

### minimal
**Use when**: Quick structural checks while wiring a workflow together.

**Surfaces**: hard errors that would stop execution (missing required fields, empty code, broken connections). Skips enum checks and all advisories.

**Fastest and most permissive.**

### runtime (RECOMMENDED default)
**Use when**: Ongoing validation as you build; the everyday profile.

**Surfaces**: errors (required fields, value types, allowed values, dependencies, broken references) plus security and deprecation warnings. **No** best-practice advisories.

**Balanced — catches everything that breaks, stays quiet about style.**

### ai-friendly
**Use when**: You want the best-practice advice before deploying.

**Surfaces**: everything `runtime` does, **plus** best-practice advisories — per-node "without error handling" suggestions, "webhook should always send a response", rate-limit notes, outdated-`typeVersion` suggestions, `cachedResultName` and long-chain hints.

**Note**: `ai-friendly` is *stricter* than `runtime`, not looser. (Older docs described it as reducing false positives — that was true only while profile gating was broken; it is fixed now.)

### strict
**Use when**: Hardening a production-critical workflow.

**Surfaces**: everything `ai-friendly` does, **plus** leftover-property checks ("property 'X' won't be used — not visible with current settings").

**Maximum lint.** With the false positives fixed at the source, its warnings are advice to weigh, not noise to fight.

---

## Common Error Types

Five core error types, in rough order of frequency:

- **`missing_required`** — a required field isn't provided. Use `get_node` to see required fields, then add it.
- **`invalid_value`** — value doesn't match allowed options (enums are case-sensitive). Check the error's allowed list or `get_node`.
- **`type_mismatch`** — wrong data type (string `"100"` vs number `100`). Convert to the expected type.
- **`invalid_expression`** — expression syntax error (missing `{{}}`, typos). See the n8n Expression Syntax skill.
- **`invalid_reference`** — referenced node doesn't exist (renamed, deleted, or misspelled). Fix the name or `cleanStaleConnections`.

A sixth class, **`patchNodeField` errors** (find-not-found, ambiguous match, invalid/unsafe regex), surfaces when a `patchNodeField` op fails during `n8n_update_partial_workflow` — it's strict by design and errors rather than silently continuing.

Every type above has worked examples (broken config → fix) plus the patchNodeField error cases and their fixes in **[ERROR_CATALOG.md](ERROR_CATALOG.md)**.

---

## Auto-Sanitization System

**Automatically normalizes common operator structures** on ANY workflow update — `n8n_create_workflow`, `n8n_update_partial_workflow`, or any save. Trust it; don't hand-fix these.

**What it normalizes on save**:
- **Binary operators** (equals, notEquals, contains, notContains, greaterThan, lessThan, startsWith, endsWith) — removes a stray `singleValue` property.
- **Unary operators** (isEmpty, isNotEmpty, true, false) — adds `singleValue: true`.
- **IF/Switch metadata** — fills in `conditions.options` for IF v2.2+ and Switch v3.2+.

**Validation no longer errors on these shapes** (n8n-mcp ≥ 2.63.0). n8n derives unary-ness from the operator name and defaults the `conditions.options` sub-fields, so `validate_node` / `validate_workflow` accept a condition whether or not `singleValue` and the options metadata are present — the sanitizer just tidies the canonical form on save. (Older servers wrongly errored on the un-normalized shape; if you see that, upgrade.) What still *is* a real error: a v1-shaped `conditions` object on a v2 node, an empty filter with no conditions, and legacy v1 operator names (e.g. `smaller`) inside a v2 structure.

**What the sanitizer CANNOT fix** (handle manually): broken connections to non-existent nodes (use `cleanStaleConnections`), branch-count mismatches (add/remove connections or rules), and paradoxical corrupt states (may need manual DB intervention).

Before/after examples and the full cannot-fix detail are in **[ERROR_CATALOG.md](ERROR_CATALOG.md)** (Auto-Sanitization sections).

---

## False Positives

The validator overhaul (n8n-mcp ≥ 2.63.0) removed the classic false positives — template literals inside expressions, optional chaining, omitted-operation defaults, the Webhook → Respond-to-Webhook pattern, IF/Filter legacy shapes, and more no longer fire.

**Known exceptions (n8n-mcp 2.85.0, reported upstream; re-check after upgrading):**

- **ERROR "Incorrect error output configuration… appear to be error handlers but are in main[0]"** on a fan-out where one target is a Respond to Webhook or Send Email node, or has *error / fail / catch / exception* in its name. Moving Respond to Webhook onto `main[1]`, as suggested, means the webhook only answers when the upstream node fails. Treat it as a false positive **only when** the message matches this text exactly **and** you've inspected `connections` and confirmed the named node sits on the success path by design. In that case keep the wiring, say in your reply that you're ignoring n8n-mcp#1111 and why, and **don't run `n8n_autofix_workflow` with the default fix types** (exclude `error-output-config`, or it may rewire the success path). Every other `valid: false` error still gets fixed. ([n8n-mcp#1111](https://github.com/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp/issues/1111))
- **Warning "Possible missing $ prefix"** on `json`/`items` *inside a string*, e.g. `$jmespath($('X').all(), "[?json.country=='PL'].json.name")`. The `json.` prefix is required there, so ignore the warning. ([#1115](https://github.com/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp/issues/1115))
- **`validate_node` on a `language: "pythonNative"` Code node → "Code cannot be empty" (`jsCode`)**. The error is false; validate the workflow instead. ([#1112](https://github.com/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp/issues/1112))
- **Python "Return value must be a list of dicts"** for a single-dict return in all-items mode. n8n accepts it and emits one item. ([#1113](https://github.com/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp/issues/1113))

**Blind spots (valid workflow, wrong result at runtime):** `$jmespath` syntax/quoting mistakes inside expressions ([#1114](https://github.com/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp/issues/1114)); *any* JS error inside `{{ }}`, which resolves to `null` while the execution stays green (see **n8n-expression-syntax**); native-Python mistakes such as legacy `_input`/`_json`, dot access, blocked imports and classes ([#1113](https://github.com/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp/issues/1113), see **n8n-code-python**). Validation plus a successful run still isn't proof: inspect the output values.

What remains are **best-practice advisories** (surfaced only under `ai-friendly` / `strict`) that flag a real trade-off but may be acceptable in your case. Not every advisory needs a fix — many are context-dependent. Common ones and when each is acceptable vs. worth fixing:

- **"...without error handling"** — OK for dev/testing and non-critical notifications; fix for production handling important data. (Never a hard error — style doesn't block execution.)
- **"No retry logic"** — OK for idempotent ops, APIs with their own retry, manual triggers; fix for flaky external services and production automation.
- **"...rate limits and transient failures"** — OK for internal/low-volume/server-side-limited APIs; fix for public, high-volume APIs.
- **"Unbounded query"** — OK for small known datasets, aggregations, dev/testing; fix for production queries on large tables.

Security and deprecation warnings, by contrast, surface under *every* profile and should be treated as real.

Full per-case guidance, the list of what the validator no longer flags, profile strategies, the "should I fix this?" decision framework, and how to document accepted advisories are in **[FALSE_POSITIVES.md](FALSE_POSITIVES.md)**.

## Validation Result Structure

### Complete Response
```javascript
{
  "valid": false,
  "errors": [
    {
      "type": "missing_required",
      "property": "channel",
      "message": "Channel name is required",
      "fix": "Provide a channel name (lowercase, no spaces)"
    }
  ],
  "warnings": [
    {
      "type": "best_practice",
      "property": "errorHandling",
      "message": "Slack API can have rate limits",
      "suggestion": "Add onError: 'continueRegularOutput'"
    }
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "type": "optimization",
      "message": "Consider using batch operations for multiple messages"
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "hasErrors": true,
    "errorCount": 1,
    "warningCount": 1,
    "suggestionCount": 1
  }
}
```

### How to Read It

1. **Check `valid` first** — `true` means the config is valid; `false` means there are errors to fix before deployment.
2. **Fix `errors` first** — each carries a `property`, `message`, and `fix`. These must be resolved.
3. **Review `warnings`** — each has a `message` and `suggestion`; decide per-case whether to address it (see False Positives above).
4. **Consider `suggestions`** — optional improvements, not required.

## Workflow Validation

### validate_workflow (Structure)
**Validates entire workflow**, not just individual nodes

**Checks**:
1. **Node configurations** - Each node valid
2. **Connections** - No broken references
3. **Expressions** - Syntax and references valid
4. **Flow** - Logical workflow structure

**Example**:
```javascript
validate_workflow({
  workflow: {
    nodes: [...],
    connections: {...}
  },
  options: {
    validateNodes: true,
    validateConnections: true,
    validateExpressions: true,
    profile: "runtime"
  }
})
```

### Common Workflow Errors

#### 1. Broken Connections
```json
{
  "error": "Connection from 'Transform' to 'NonExistent' - target node not found"
}
```

**Fix**: Remove stale connection or create missing node

#### 2. Cycles (warning, not an error)
```json
{
  "warning": "Workflow contains a cycle: Node A → Node B → Node A"
}
```

A cycle is a **warning**, not a hard error (n8n-mcp ≥ 2.63.0) — runtime-controlled loops (error-retry, data-driven pagination, a router feeding back) execute to completion and are legitimate. **Fix** only if the loop is unintentional: ensure the cycle has a real exit (a conditional node, an error output, or a bounded counter) so it can't spin forever.

#### 3. Multiple Start Nodes
```json
{
  "warning": "Multiple trigger nodes found - only one will execute"
}
```

**Fix**: Remove extra triggers or split into separate workflows

#### 4. Disconnected Nodes
```json
{
  "warning": "Node 'Transform' is not connected to workflow flow"
}
```

**Fix**: Connect node or remove if unused

## Recovery Strategies

### Strategy 1: Start Fresh
**When**: Configuration is severely broken

**Steps**:
1. Note required fields from `get_node`
2. Create minimal valid configuration
3. Add features incrementally
4. Validate after each addition

### Strategy 2: Binary Search
**When**: Workflow validates but executes incorrectly

**Steps**:
1. Remove half the nodes
2. Validate and test
3. If works: problem is in removed nodes
4. If fails: problem is in remaining nodes
5. Repeat until problem isolated

### Strategy 3: Clean Stale Connections
**When**: "Node not found" errors

**Steps**:
```javascript
n8n_update_partial_workflow({
  id: "workflow-id",
  operations: [{
    type: "cleanStaleConnections"
  }]
})
```

### Strategy 4: Use Auto-fix
**When**: Validation errors that can be automatically resolved

**Steps**:
```javascript
// Preview fixes (default - doesn't apply)
n8n_autofix_workflow({
  id: "workflow-id",
  applyFixes: false,
  confidenceThreshold: "medium"  // high, medium, low
})

// Review fixes, then apply
n8n_autofix_workflow({
  id: "workflow-id",
  applyFixes: true
})
```

---

## Auto-Fix Capabilities

The `n8n_autofix_workflow` tool can fix these issue types:

1. **expression-format** - Missing `=` prefix in expressions (e.g., `{{ $json.field }}` → `={{ $json.field }}`)
2. **typeversion-correction** - Downgrades nodes with unsupported typeVersions
3. **error-output-config** - Removes conflicting onError settings
4. **node-type-correction** - Fixes unknown node types using similarity matching (90%+ confidence)
5. **webhook-missing-path** - Generates UUIDs for webhook nodes missing path configuration
6. **typeversion-upgrade** - Smart upgrades to latest node versions with auto-migration
7. **version-migration** - Guidance for complex breaking changes requiring manual steps

**Confidence levels**: `high` (90%+, safe to auto-apply), `medium` (70-89%, review recommended), `low` (<70%, manual review required)

```javascript
// Preview all fixes
n8n_autofix_workflow({id: "workflow-id"})

// Only apply high-confidence fixes
n8n_autofix_workflow({
  id: "workflow-id",
  applyFixes: true,
  confidenceThreshold: "high"
})

// Target specific fix types
n8n_autofix_workflow({
  id: "workflow-id",
  fixTypes: ["expression-format", "typeversion-upgrade"],
  applyFixes: true
})
```

**Post-update guidance**: For version upgrades, check the `postUpdateGuidance` field in the response for step-by-step migration instructions.

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do

- Validate after every significant change
- Read error messages completely
- Fix errors iteratively (one at a time)
- Use `runtime` profile for pre-deployment
- Check `valid` field before assuming success
- Trust auto-sanitization for operator issues
- Use `get_node` when unclear about requirements
- Document false positives you accept

### ❌ Don't

- Skip validation before activation
- Try to fix all errors at once
- Ignore error messages
- Use `strict` profile during development (too noisy)
- Assume validation passed (always check result)
- Manually fix auto-sanitization issues
- Deploy with unresolved errors
- Ignore all warnings (some are important!)

## Running the workflow after it validates

`validate_workflow` checks structure, parameters and expressions — it never runs anything. A workflow that validates cleanly can still fail on real data, so run it once before calling it done.

**With a webhook, form or chat trigger:** `n8n_test_workflow({workflowId})` — the default `method: "auto"` detects the trigger and fires it over HTTP (the workflow must be active).

**Without such a trigger** (Manual Trigger, Schedule, sub-workflow) there is no HTTP entry point. Use the pin-data path, which runs through n8n's own MCP server (`N8N_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN`, n8n 2.34+):

1. `n8n_test_workflow({workflowId, method: "prepare"})` — lists the nodes that need pinned data.
2. Build one sample item per listed node, keyed by node **name**, each item wrapped in `{json: {...}}`:
   ```json
   {"When clicking 'Test workflow'": [{"json": {"orderId": "1234", "email": "a@b.com"}}]}
   ```
   A flat object instead of an array of `{json}` items is the usual mistake here.
3. `n8n_test_workflow({workflowId, method: "pinned", pinData})` — runs it with that data and waits for the result.

**For a quick manual run without pinned data**, `method: "direct"` starts a manual execution and returns as soon as it has started; poll `n8n_executions({action: "get", id: executionId, mode: "error"})` for the outcome. Nothing is pinned on a `direct` run, so every node executes and any external call it makes is real — and even `pinned` only pins trigger, credentialed and HTTP Request nodes. `executionMode: "production"` changes the execution context, not whether there are side effects; leave it at the default unless the user asked for a production run.

**`method: "auto"` never runs a workflow through n8n's MCP server.** On a workflow with no external trigger it reports that fact and names `prepare`/`pinned`/`direct`; the routed methods only run when you ask for them by name.

**Consent before the first routed run.** n8n refuses these calls for a workflow whose "Available in MCP" setting is off, which comes back as `WORKFLOW_NOT_EXPOSED`. Re-running with `exposeToMcp: true` turns that setting on and retries once. It is a visible, persistent setting on the workflow (and enabling it is a workflow update, so a concurrent UI edit can be overwritten) — **ask the user before passing it**. The consent flow only ever enables the setting; nothing disables it implicitly. Turning it off again is a deliberate act: `n8n_update_partial_workflow({id: workflowId, operations: [{type: "updateSettings", settings: {availableInMCP: false}}]})`, or the toggle in the n8n UI.

**Reading the result:** a run that started and then failed comes back as `EXECUTION_FAILED` with the `executionId` — inspect it with `n8n_executions({action: "get", id, mode: "error"})` and fix from the node that threw, then validate and run again.

---

## Reviewing an existing workflow

Validating as you build (the loop above) is for catching schema and shape errors in your own in-progress work. **Reviewing an existing workflow** — yours or one you've been handed — is a different job: the workflow already passes `validate_workflow` clean, and you're hunting for the issues validation doesn't see (silent connection bugs, injection-prone queries, dropped-item Switches, Set/Code antipatterns, missing error paths). For that, pull the workflow with `n8n_get_workflow` and walk **[REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md](REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md)** — a severity-tiered audit (MUST FIX / SHOULD FIX / NICE TO HAVE) where every item points to the canonical skill for the fix. Run `n8n_audit_instance` alongside it to surface hardcoded secrets and unauthenticated webhooks across the whole instance.

## Summary

**Key Points**:
1. **Validation is iterative** (avg 2-3 cycles, 23s + 58s)
2. **Errors must be fixed**, warnings are optional
3. **Auto-sanitization** normalizes operator structures on save; validation no longer errors on the raw shape
4. **Use runtime profile** by default; step up to `ai-friendly`/`strict` for best-practice advisories
5. **Classic false positives are fixed** (≥ 2.63.0) — remaining warnings are advisories or security/deprecation notices, not validator mistakes
6. **Read error messages** - they contain fix guidance

**Validation Process**:
1. Validate → Read errors → Fix → Validate again
2. Repeat until valid (usually 2-3 iterations)
3. Review warnings and decide if acceptable
4. Deploy with confidence
